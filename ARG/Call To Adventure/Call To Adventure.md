Welcome prospective Maths Society Members!!

We have been sent a puzzle given to us for you to solve.


[[Call To Adventure enciphered]]
~ciphertext~

Dear Seeker of the Truth
I dearly hope this invitation has been able to reach you. As you may have heard, Professor Zeno has recently been captured and everyone is unsure who the perpetrator is, but I do know who and why. A man by the name of Terrence D. Howard has captured Professor Zeno for use in his nefarious plan in undermining logic and destroying Mathematics at itâ€™s root.

I am unable to communicate openly as Terrence has hired someone to intercept my messages in the past, so we must use more discreet forms of communication. To Terrence I am sure this looks like gibberish and he shall ignore it.

I have sent out this invitation to others like you, others who will be able to assist in finding out where Zeno is being held, others who are capable of solving such puzzles. Terrence is trying to disprove logic and break maths as we know it, and the first step he has in his plan is capturing Professor Zeno and brainwashing all of his future Maths students into thinking 1\*1 is 2, and turning fact into fiction. We must foil his plans for the sake of logic and rationale persevering into the future.

This time I need your help for I cannot do it alone. Me and my compatriots of the [[Cryptographic table]] have been having a harder and harder time solving his challenges, and we need help to discredit Terrence once and for all. 

If you have been able to read this message then you are on the right track to save maths. The road ahead is long and I cannot disclose much at the moment but I shall contact you through the Mathematics Society events since that is when Howard taunts us with his clues.

For now, await further instructions and meet your fellow compatriots who will be able to help you on this quest. Here is where you can find them [discordLink].

May the odds be ever in your favour,
