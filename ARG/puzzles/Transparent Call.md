We invite you to join the Mathematics Society! We offer a blend of academic seminars, exciting social events such as board game nights, a pizza party, movie nights, ice-skating, and an opportunity to meet like minded people at our seminars and events. Meet our mascot, the Tortoise Professor Zeno, and be a part of a community that shares your passion in mathematics. 

For those interested in solving a little more throughout the year, we are collaborating with the Order of The Abacus who have promised many puzzles that will test your logical thinking, mathematical history and detective skills. There are even prizes to those that can reach the end.

Dear Seeker of /c(Truth),

I hope that this message find you well, and I must apologise as the computers have been acting up and some of the text got jumbled, but I assure you that everything you need to proceed with the game is within this message.

First of all, I would like to introduce you to Professor Zeno, who is the leader of the Order of the Abacus. He liked these puzzles and I hope you can see him with them as well. Unfortunately, he has chosen to take a sudden holiday, we are not sure where he is but Professor Terrance has given his word that he is in no dang~c(lies).

Here is your riddle:
In 1990, a person is 15 years old. In 1995, [that same person is] {this bit is all ciphered as the discord link}  10 years old. How can this be?
