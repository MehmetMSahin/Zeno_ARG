Welcome to the Mathematics Society! 

We offer academic seminars, social events like board game nights, pizza parties, movie nights, and ice-skating. Meet our mascot, Professor Zeno the Tortoise, and connect with fellow math enthusiasts.

For puzzle lovers, we are partnering with the Order of The Abacus to bring you challenging puzzles throughout the year, testing your logical thinking, mathematical history, and detective skills. Prizes await those who solve them all. A message from Sir Caeser introduces your first puzzle.

Dear Seeker of /c(Truth),

I hope this message finds you well. I apologize for any confusion caused by printing errors that scrambled some text. But rest assured, all the information you need for the game is included here.

Before the fun puzzle solving starts, let me introduce you to Professor Zeno, who is the leader of the Order of the Abacus. He is an incredible mathematician and a puzzle fan, who taught us everything we know. Unfortunately, he has chosen to take a sudden holiday, we are not sure where he is but Professor Terrance has given his word that he is in no dan~c(lies).

Here is your riddle:
In 1990, a person is 15 years old. In 1995, [that same person is] {this bit is all ciphered as the discord link}  10 years old. How can this be?
