We invite you to join the Mathematics Society! We offer a blend of academic seminars, exciting social events such as board game nights, a pizza party, movie nights, ice-skating, and an opportunity to meet like minded people at our seminars and events. Meet our mascot, the Tortoise Professor Zeno, and be a part of a community that shares your passion in mathematics. 

For those interested in solving a little more throughout the year, Maths committee has been sent a puzzle to solve. So far we have been unable to decipher these strange words but we've been assured prizes remain at the end. 

This puzzle here was given to us by someone claiming to be Sir Caesar.
