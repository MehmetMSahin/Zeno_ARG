I have sent out this invitation to others like you, others who will be able to assist in finding where Zeno is being held, others who are capable of solving such puzzles.

Dear Seeker of Truth

I dearly hope this invitation has been able to reach you. As you may have heard, Professor Zeno has been kidnapped and everyone is pointing fingers, but we have found out that Professor Terrence D. Howard has captured Professor Zeno. Terrence is using Zeno in his nefarious plan to undermine logic and destroying Mathematics at itâ€™s root. The first step he has in his plan is capturing Professor Zeno and brainwashing Zeno into thinking 1*1 is 2, turning fact into fiction, and fiction into fact. 

I am unable to communicate openly as Terrence has hired someone to intercept my messages in the past, so we must use more discreet forms of communication. To Terrence I am sure this looks like gibberish and he shall ignore it. We must foil his plans for the sake of logic and rationale persevering into the future. 

If you have been able to read this message then you are on the right track to save maths. For now, meet your fellow compatriots who will be able to help you on this quest. To reach them you must first join [discord Link], then contact me with your student ID to gain full access. More instructions will arrive soon. 

May the odds be ever in your favour,
Sir Caesar
