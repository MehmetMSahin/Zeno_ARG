Each event will have a self contained mission.
Each mission will start with some very basic riddle that will direct people to a video/website/note that tells them how Terrance is planning to break maths by using the X paradox.
They'll then have to solve a new puzzle which will have them input the solution to the paradox into somewhere.
Finally a discord message or some other form of confirmation of success followed by a harder riddle to help locate Zeno or just a letter to help locate Zeno.
